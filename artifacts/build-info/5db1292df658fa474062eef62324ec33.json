of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data. The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. _Available since v3.4._\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/erc20/draft-EIP712.sol\":\"EIP712\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/erc20/ECDSA.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5d07471e85bae8eba8e9a2283fdebf9300b2737396a8cd28ee70be56dd50c0d2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://54ea2f7d26fcc4b6ab42c5f833aa0c5ee52a4b78e1430a3d1f51d5ee37356f9e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmaTjYsGxNNPXfsK6WBTeoeBwgSPPuYgTM6zsahxA28FhX\"]},\"contracts/erc20/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x9fe90e5fca12379b3a035ab6fc09cde321f76cff7f9ba7449480a2943067b803\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fb47ec8642da05d543006249072028ec3f12558fcdb7bdb59740778ea79359b7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWA35aqB4Q5KBmkoBQHvKsrNkBrj27VsNJmWAykdZLtkY\"]},\"contracts/erc20/draft-EIP712.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1417e1f8897d6dae0df7340bd93d028a2cb67f137a221cadf9801094233c0095\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8bfa864f17c7c09758c7b4678ba84e9a9c4f772568edcae4cfd9daa87a6301b0\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTJkQFFRf6nAg8a6WKHtRsrDtz9DGPBYeYH5o7FM38VAM\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[],"types":null}}},"contracts/erc20/draft-IERC20Permit.sol":{"IERC20Permit":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"name":"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR","outputs":[{"internalType":"bytes32","name":"","type":"bytes32"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"}],"name":"nonces","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"value","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"deadline","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"bytes","name":"signature","type":"bytes"}],"name":"permit","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()":"3644e515","nonces(address)":"7ecebe00","permit(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)":"9fd5a6cf"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.7.0+commit.9e61f92b\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes32\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bytes32\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"owner\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"nonces\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"owner\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"spender\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"value\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"deadline\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"bytes\",\"name\":\"signature\",\"type\":\"bytes\"}],\"name\":\"permit\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
